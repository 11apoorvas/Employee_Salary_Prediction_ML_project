Developed a salary prediction model using regression techniques to estimate employee compensation based on factors like experience, education, previous salary, and job role.

Performed extensive data preprocessing, including categorical encoding, outlier detection, and feature scaling to improve model accuracy.

Evaluated multiple machine learning models (Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest) and selected the best-performing model based on RMSE and RÂ² score.

Automated the data-driven salary estimation process to help HR make fair and competitive salary offers for new hires at TechWorks Consulting.

Documented insights and created an interactive Jupyter Notebook with visualizations, data cleaning logic, model comparisons, and recommendations for further improvements.
